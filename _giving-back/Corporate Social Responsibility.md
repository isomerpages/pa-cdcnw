Staying healthy is important to all regardless of your age. Participate in our Healthy Living programmes, or email us at northwest_cdc@pa.gov.sg if your organisation has a meaningful project meant for the promotion of a healthy lifestyle. 

 **Green Living**  

Protecting the environment is everyone’s responsibility. At North West CDC, sustainbility has been a big part of our daily work. We focused on ground-up initiatives, working with schools and various partners to promote the idea and bring the idea of sustainability closer to our community. If your organisation 
has a green idea or project to implement, email northwest_cdc@pa.gov.sg for more information.
