Everyone has a part to play in making a difference to the community that we work and live in. North West CDC supports corporates and community organisations by connecting our partners' resources to the needs in the community.

Find out more about the various areas that your organisation can do with us:

**Community Engagement**<br>
[North West Service Weeks](https://northwest.cdc.gov.sg/programmes/connecting-the-community/nw-serviceweeks/) is our quarterly distribution drive to support residents in need. Your organisation can be a part of a meaningful cause to uplift the lives of needy residents by volunteering your time at our Pop-Up Markets, and/or providing home improvement services, household necessities or vouchers, to help needy residents defray essential household expenses.

For more information, email northwestcdc_partnerships@pa.gov.sg.    

 **Green Living**<br>
At North West, sustainability has been a big part of our daily work. We work with schools and various community partners to promote green living and bring the idea of sustainability closer to our community. Schools and community organisations can tap on the [North West GIRAFFE Fund](https://northwest.cdc.gov.sg/programmes/bonding-the-people/northwest-giraffe-fund/) to bring your green idea to life, or partner us on various green initiatives to do your part for our environment. 

**Healthy Living**<br>
Staying healthy is important to all regardless of your age. Participate in our [Healthy Living programmes](https://northwest.cdc.gov.sg/programmes/promoting-health-and-wellness/healthiersgfestnw/), or partner us on various initiatives to promote physical and/or mental well-being.
