Volunteering is not just about giving or helping the less fortunate. In many ways, volunteers experience plenty of benefits by just devoting their time and effort in helping the community.

The North West CDC works closely with our strong network of partners, Social Service Agencies, Government Agencies and Grassroots Organisations to provide opportunities for volunteering.

Every year, student and individual volunteers as well as corporate and community partners are recognised for their immense contributions in serving the North West community. Many of whom have dedicated their time and service to support the community, working closely with North West CDC to lend a helping hand to needy residents, spur the community to adopt a healthy lifestyle, and champion green causes.
