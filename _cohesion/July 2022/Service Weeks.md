        <p>The North West CDC is constantly exploring ways to connect our partners to the needs in the community. An expansion from the <strong>WeCare @ North West Service Weeks</strong> programme’s usual food distribution at the start of the year, the CDC distributed health and hygiene products to 7,000 needy residents for the first time.</p>  
        <p>Each care pack worth around $200 consists of eight items: handwash, sanitizer, wet wipes, as well as five different types of vitamins. As the nation transits into a Covid-19 resilient community, the health and hygiene care pack distribution aims to promote good health and hygiene habits. All items in the care packs were fully sponsored by the CDC’s two corporate partners, Guardian Health &amp; Beauty and Thunderquote. </p>

        </p>
        <p>To manage the scale of preparing 7,000 care packs, North West CDC rallied various corporate and community volunteers to step forward and support the cause. The care packs were first packed at two schools, Wellington Primary and Woodlands Secondary Schools, and then distributed by the local North West Divisions to their residents in June, through house visits and distribution drives.</p>

I hope to be able to work the CDC on more programmes which enrich our students’ learning outside of the classroom.”</em></p>

With North West CDC, there are definitely areas where we can work hand in hand to engage and offer support for our residents.

        <p>Mdm Tan: <em>“This is the first time we receive the hand santizer and vitamins. I think it is very good for us as it can be expensive to purchase these items and it is useful as I can give the vitamins to my daughter to boost her immunity against Covid-19.”</em></p>
