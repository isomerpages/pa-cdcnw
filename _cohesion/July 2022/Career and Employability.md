        <p style="font-family: Arial, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; text-align: justify;">Whether you're looking for a job, switching career or finding something to do after not being in the workforce for some time, don't worry, we've got you! The North West CDC Careers & Employability Job Fair offers many opportunities to explore new career options, skills upgrading as well as career matching services and career coaches to answer your most pressing questions.</p>

        <p style="font-family: Arial, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; text-align: justify;">This job fair is part of the Maybank - CDC Jobs and Skills series which brings curated jobs to the community while helping employers meet their manpower needs.</p>

        <p style="font-family: Arial, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; text-align: justify;">The event was especially helpful for applicants to learn and identify the most in-demand emerging skills at the SkillsFuture Learning Stations. The personality tests conducted at these stations determines the strengths and interests of a job seeker. Once they know their RIASEC profile, they will be able to make better career choices.</p>

        <p style="font-family: Arial, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; text-align: justify;"><strong>We met a couple of applicants, here's what they have to say.</strong></p>

        <p style="font-family: Arial, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; text-align: justify;">We met a full-time mom who wants to return to the work force and a retiree who wants to continue working to remain active. They spoke to the career coaches, who gave them advice to get back on the work track.</p>

                <p style="font-size: x-large; color: #509b84;"><em>"The job fair was very helpful especially for people like me who have lost touch, as I haven't been at work for 12 years. I chose to take care of my children and see them through school. The job fair enabled me to find out what's happening outside. Some industries are dying, some are booming, so we have to know what is required from an applicant." She also spoke about how, at her age, she cannot afford to be job hopping. "I want to do something I can enjoy. The personality tests helped me narrow down what industry is suitable for me."</em></p>

I retired, but after 4 years, I feel like I want to do something, you know, to keep me active. I don't want to work in security anymore, it's always standing for long hours and hard on my knees. I took the job-matching advise and they guided me very well. They offered me a part-time job as a cleaner, it's ok, I accepted it, as I will be able to move around."</em></p>

            <p style="color: #509b84; font-size: large; font-weight: bold;">Get in the Right Frame of Mind</p>
            <p>It's all in the mindset. Practice as if you're already returning to work. Speak confidently as if you're interacting with potential employers and colleagues. Be professional and practice good grooming.</p>
        </div>

        <div style="width: 80%; margin:  auto;  display: inline-block; font-family: Arial, serif; text-align: center">

            <p style="color: #509b84; font-size: large; font-weight: bold;">Seek Advice From Working Moms</p>
            <p>Try to connect with other working mothers and see how they balance work life and family life. You'll be surprised at the many tips they will be able to share.</p>

            <p style="color: #509b84; font-size: large; font-weight: bold;">Determine What You Really Want</p>
            <p>Are you thinking about going back to your old career because it's more comfortable than starting over? Or perhaps you want to try something new? Determine what you truly want to do, and figure out the steps you need to take to make it happen.</p>
        </div>

            <p style="color: #509b84; font-size: large; font-weight: bold;">Make a Job Search Plan</p>
            <p>Create a job search plan. Knowing what you need to do and when you need to do it will help keep you on track and give you actionable tasks to work on.</p>
        </div>

            <p style="color: #509b84; font-size: large; font-weight: bold;">Upgrade Your Skills </p>
            <p>Many people have more than one social media account. But, even if you have only one account, make sure it's up to date and looks presentable. Optimise your LinkedIn profile. Not only does it give you a chance to showcase your relevant skills, but it's also a great way to show you're involved and active in your subject area.</p>
        </div>

        <div style="width: 80%; margin:  auto;  display: inline-block; font-family: Arial, serif; text-align: center">
            <img src="images/t6.png" style="width:  100%; max-width: 100px;" alt="..." />
            <p style="color: #509b84; font-size: large; font-weight: bold;">Own It</p>
            <p>Don't hide your time off raising a family. Depending on how long you were out of work for, you likely acquired many transferable skills that can be used in the workplace. Mention any volunteer work, side projects, and freelance work you did while taking care of your family. </p>
        </div>

        <div style="width: 80%; margin:  auto;  display: inline-block; font-family: Arial, serif; text-align: center">
            <img src="images/t7.png" style="width:  100%; max-width: 100px;" alt="..." />
            <p style="color: #509b84; font-size: large; font-weight: bold;">Set Boundaries</p>
            <p>Once you get back to work, you may find yourself doing everything you can to prove you can do it all. But in reality, that isn't healthy for your own work-life balance. If you have appointments, be clear and let your team know. Set boundaries and make sure you enforce them.</p>
        </div>

        <div style="width: 80%; margin:  auto;  display: inline-block; font-family: Arial, serif; text-align: center">

            <p style="color: #509b84; font-size: large; font-weight: bold;">Update Your Social Profiles</p>
            <p>Many people have more than one social media account. But, even if you have only one account, make sure it's up to date and looks presentable. Optimise your LinkedIn profile.
