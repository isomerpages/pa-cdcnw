The Community Development Councils (CDCs) were established to build a tightly knit, compassionate and self-reliant community. **North West CDC** works closely with various community and corporate partners to strengthen Singaporeâ€™s social fabric; and encourages the more able and successful to come forward to help the less successful, and to foster greater sense of community ownership and self-help among the residents.

We strive to align our activities and efforts with our mission:

(a) **Aggregator of Needs and Resources**<br>
To help the less fortunate through local assistance programmes

(b) **Builder of Capabilities and Capacities**<br>
To bond the community through projects &amp; programmes to bring them closer to one another

(c) **Connector of Communities**<br>
To develop strategic partnerships with corporate and community partners to better serve our residents

To achieve our mission, North West CDC continues to build programmes to provide support to residents under our five community pillars:

**i. Caring Communities**<br>
Encourage a giving culture and uplift the lives of residents through social support programmes and networks

**ii. Healthy Communities**<br>
Promote healthy lifestyle, encourage residents to bond and take charge of their own health

**iii. Inclusive Communities**<br>
Strengthen social fabric by embracing and involving different segments of society

**iv. Learning Communities**<br>
Promote lifelong learning mindset for personal and professional development

**v. Sustainable Communities**<br>
Cultivate an eco-friendly lifestyle and building a green environment for our future generations
