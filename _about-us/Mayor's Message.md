The CDC sits in a unique position to play the role of the enabler in the district, through forming meaningful networks and connecting our partners to the needs in the community.

In line with building up a Covid-19 resilient community, we plan to resume in-person community programmes and as we increase our engagements on ground, we hope to garner more participation and promote volunteerism to support our residents.

So join us on this meaningful journey as we build a caring and healthy North West community together.

**Alex Yam**<br>
Mayor of North West District
