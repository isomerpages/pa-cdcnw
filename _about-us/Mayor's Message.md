The CDC sits in a unique position to play the role of the enabler in the district, through forming meaningful networks and connecting our partners to the needs in the community.

At North West CDC, we are constantly exploring new and innovative ways to address the gaps in the community by working with our partners to provide regular support in different areas of need.

Whether it is to promote health and wellness through our Healthy Living clubs, advocate green living by bringing sustainability closer to our community, or uplifting the community through assistance schemes, the CDC hopes to increase our engagements on ground to garner more participation and promote volunteerism to support our residents.

So join us on this meaningful journey as we build a caring and healthy North West community together.

**Alex Yam**<br>
Mayor of North West District
