**DigiReady @ North West** is an initiative to provide holistic support to vulnerable residents in the following aspects of digital readiness: refurbished devices and accessories, subsidised broadband, and troubleshooting faulty digital devices.

**1. Support on Digital Devices**

Students, seniors and families from low-income backgrounds may request for free refurbished devices through our community partners (e.g. Community Clubs and Social Service Agencies).

**2. Subsidised broadband**

The scheme further subsidises broadband access for beneficiaries under IMDA's Home Access Scheme, by providing additional subsidies of up to $10 per month, for a period of two years.
