**HealthierSG Fest @ North West** is a new flagship event to promote healthy living in the North West District. The sports festival encourages the community to adopt a healthier lifestyle and embrace the differences between individuals to build a caring and healthy North West District.

In-line with Healthier SG's preventive health approach, the first edition of the HealthierSG Fest @ North West brought together North West residents of all ages and abilities, including differently-abled residents through a fun-filled event that features over 20 sports activities and try-outs.
