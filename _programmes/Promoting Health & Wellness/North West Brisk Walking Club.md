Officially launched in 2002, the **North West Brisk Walking Club** has grown to become the largest brisk walking club in Singapore.

Â Members from the North West Brisk Walking Club head for weekly walks around their residential estates, and are treated to occasional brisk walking trips around different scenic locations in Singapore. Novelty brisk walk events had been organised for the members, such as the North West 15 Km Brisk Walk Challenge and North West Walk N Shop. In addition to staying healthy, brisk walking is also a great platform for the members to bond and make friends.

Residents who are interested in joining the North West Brisk Walking Club may proceed to their nearest RC.
