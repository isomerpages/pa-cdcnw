**Mental Wellness @ North West** is part of the CDC's Healthy Living @ North West programmes in promoting holistic wellness. Launched in 2021, it aims to raise awareness of mental wellness in the community.  
  
The initiative brings together healthcare experts, community and corporate partners, and fellow residents to build up a mental wellness support network through talks and workshops.

In 2023, the programme has been expanded to include **Mental Wellness Ambassadors** who will support the North West community in developing resiliency, well-being, and help residents get access to mental health services early. They will provide basic mental and emotional support to the community and help to drive mental wellness activities such as co-organising mental wellness workshops or talks and share positive mental wellness tips.

Together with PsyConnect, a psychology student interest group comprising Psychology undergraduates and alumni from SUSS, to design and develop a **Mental Wellness Toolkit**, which will serve as a resource guide for caregivers and residents to better understand mental wellness, the various conditions, as well as the available resources in the North West District. You can download the Mental Wellness Toolkit [here](/files/FA_NWCDC_MentalHealthToolkit.pdf).
