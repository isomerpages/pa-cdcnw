Mental Wellness @ North West is part of the CDC's Healthy Living @ North West programmes in promoting holistic wellness. It aims to raise awareness of mental wellness in the community.  
  
The initiative brings together healthcare experts, community and corporate partners, and fellow residents to build up a mental wellness support network through talks and workshops.
