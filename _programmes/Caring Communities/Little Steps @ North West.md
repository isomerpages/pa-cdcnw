**Little Steps @ North West** provides cash assistance to children aged up to six years old, in the North West district, who are supported by KidSTART Singapore (SG). Each eligible child will receive $500 per financial year disbursed to the parents’ and caregivers’ bank accounts. The additional cash assistance will help to relieve families’ stress from upkeeping daily expenses, thus enabling them to focus on the children’s development.

Important to note:

Each eligible child will receive a letter from the North West CDC to register for Little Steps @ North West. Upon successful verification of all supporting documents, the child will be enrolled into the programme, and a confirmation letter will be mailed to the registered address.

As the applications are processed in batches, any incomplete submission of documents will result in a delay in the crediting of the cash assistance.
