<p>Healthy Living Festival @ North West is a flagship event to promote healthy
living and bonding through a line-up of wellness activities and experiences
to encourage holistic well-being in the North West District.</p>
<p>Back for its third year, Healthy Living Festival @ North West kicks off
with a month-long campaign – Healthier Together Movement, leading up to
the highly anticipated 3-day festival to celebrate SG60 through wellness.
The Healthier Together Movement invites everyone to come together and collectively
clock 60,000km through running, swimming, walking, and cycling. The 3-day
festival comes jam-packed with flea market, curated food and drinks booths,
live performances, family-friendly games, sports activities, and free try-outs
by North West Healthy Living Clubs such as FitnessX (Zumba, Kpop), Dance-Fit,
Qigong and more!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Participants can collect their game card at the information counter, explore
the festival and take part in activities to collect stamps to complete
the gamecard and redeem freebies too!</p>
