<p><strong>Healthy Living Festival @ North West </strong>is a flagship event
to promote healthy living and bonding in the North West District. The sports
festival encourages the community to adopt a healthier lifestyle and embrace
the differences between individuals to build a caring and healthy North
West District.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In-line with Healthier SG's preventive health approach, the first edition
of the HealthierSG Fest @ North West brought together North West residents
of all ages and abilities, including differently-abled residents through
a fun-filled event that features over 20 sports activities and try-outs.</p>
