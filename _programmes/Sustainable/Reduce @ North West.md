**Reduce @ North West** educates students from participating schools in the North West and equip them with the knowledge to encourage households to reduce energy and water consumption, and food wastage, through house visits and sharing these message with their network.

The Reduce @ North West challenge encourages residents to take action and do their part in fighting climate change by reducing their household energy or water consumption by at least 5% over a two-month period.
