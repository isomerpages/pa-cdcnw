  North West CDC organised the **North West Sustainability Festival 2024**, a three-day event highlighting the importance of food sustainability and demonstrating ways residents can contribute to this cause from 8 to 10 November 2024 at Hillion Mall Outdoor Plaza. More than 5,000 attendees participated in a diverse array of sustainability-focused activities.

Over 20 stakeholders, including corporate partners, community organisations, and schools, contributed to the event's content. One of the highlights of the festival was the vibrant farmers' market, where local vendors showcased and sold fresh local produce and artisanal food products. Through these engaging and educational activities, the event demonstrated the importance of sustainable food practices and their role in broader environmental conservation efforts. The event educated attendees about sustainability while bringing the community together for a shared purpose.

For 2025, get ready to learn how to recycle and upcycle everyday household items through our upcoming **FREE** workshops and activities. Stay tuned for an immersive experience that will deepen your knowledge and inspire action!
