The inaugural North West Sustainability Festival is a dynamic showcase of green efforts, with workshops and activities to encourage participants to adopt eco-friendly practices at home and protect our environment.

With different themes and activities each year, the festival aims to cultivate a green mindset within the North West community, educating residents ways to go green and how to practice at home.
