##### **Transform your everyday habits into meaningful environmental action at the North West Sustainability Festival 2025!**

Join us for an inspiring three-day celebration of green living, where you'll discover creative ways to recycle and upcycle through engaging exhibitions, hands-on workshops, and interactive activities such as VR recycling games and VR experience. 

Thread fashion creativity with a sustainable cause! Come see the fashion pieces created by our contestants from \*\*Re:Style SG60 Fashion Contest\*\* - a testament that second-hand fashion can be transformed into couture pieces suited for our Fashion Runway.

From free upcycling workshops to innovative upcycling demonstrations, this friendly festival offers a whole range of green activities and workshops for everyone.
