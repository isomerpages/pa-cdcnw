 Discover the art of sustainable living at our three-day green festival – immerse yourself in captivating exhibitions, hands-on workshops, and cutting-edge interactive experiences, including VR recycling games that bring sustainability to life.

Witness fashion innovation with a purpose as we showcase stunning pieces from preschoolers to tertiary students at the **Re:Style Fashion Runway Showcase (30 Aug)**, and **SG60 Fashion Contest  (31 Aug)** participants will demonstrate how second-hand garments can be upcycled into runway-worthy couture in celebration of our nation's 60th birthday.
