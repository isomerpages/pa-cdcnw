Join us for an inspiring three-day celebration of green living, where you'll discover creative ways to recycle and upcycle through engaging exhibitions, hands-on workshops, and interactive activities such as VR recycling games and VR experience. 

Thread your fashion creativity with a sustainable cause! Join our **Re:Style SG60 Fashion Contest** and prove that second-hand fashion can be transformed into couture pieces suited for our Fashion Runway. Whether you're an aspiring designer or simply love sustainable fashion, this is your chance to showcase your style – so what are you waiting for!
