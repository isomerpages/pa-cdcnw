**Recycle @ North West (Schools)** works closely with schools within the North West District to instill good recycling habits from young. The programme encourages schools to set up recycling points, where students will gather to collect recyclables at least once a month and put proper recycling knowledge to good use. Schools are also encouraged to recycle e-waste on an annual basis.

Active recycling breaks away from the current recycling practices. Students will learn more about resource conservation, get hands-on in sorting the recyclables and gain in-depth knoweldge on green education.
