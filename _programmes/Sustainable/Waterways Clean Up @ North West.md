In collaboration with the Waterways Watch Society (WWS), **Waterways Clean-up @ North West** aims to impart the importance of protection and conservation within our waterways to primary and secondary schools in the North West.

Through the programme, students will learn about Singapore’s unique waterways system and the importance of conserving and keeping Singapore’s water resources clean. Students also go on learning trails as well as litter monitoring programmes to raise their environmental awareness.
