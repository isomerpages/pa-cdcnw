<h4>ArtsEverywhere@CDC</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov.sg/artseverywhere-cdc/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ArtsEverywhere@CDC</a> is
a collaboration between the National Arts Council, People's Association,&nbsp;and
the five Community Development Councils, and is supported by the Ministry
of Culture, Community and Youth. Bringing arts experiences to communities
where they live, work and play, members of the public can look forward
to arts performances, workshops and activities around Singapore, and develop
a greater appreciation for the arts through these shared experiences.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This initiative is in line with our aspiration for <em>Our SG Arts Plan (2023 - 2027)</em> to
build <em>A Connected Society</em>, where our social connections and national
identity are strengthened through the arts.</p>
