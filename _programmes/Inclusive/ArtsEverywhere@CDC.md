<h4>ArtsEverywhere@CDC</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov.sg/artseverywhere-cdc/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ArtsEverywhere@CDC,</a> a
national effort by the National Arts Council (NAC), People’s Association
(PA) and the five Community Development Councils (CDC), will bring a regular
pipeline of arts experiences at scale, to communities and heartlands, making
it more accessible for residents of all ages to enjoy and engage with the
arts together, in the vicinity of their homes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There will be large-scale monthly performances at anchor venues in each
district, including fringe arts and culture activities for all to participate
in. More than 50,000 residents are estimated to experience these art performances.</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Bringing arts into the heartlands of the North West District will enable
us to build Inclusive Communities where residents can better access and
support performances by our local artistes. Importantly, it will also bring
our residents together and create a memorable bonding experience, enjoyed
conveniently in their neighbourhood.”</p>
<p>Mr Alex Yam, Mayor of North West District</p>
