<h4>ArtsEverywhere@CDC</h4>
<p><strong>ArtsEverywhere@CDC</strong> is a collaboration between the National
Arts Council, People's Association,&nbsp;and the five Community Development
Councils, and is supported by the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth.
Bringing arts experiences to communities where they live, work and play,
members of the public can look forward to arts performances, workshops
and activities around Singapore, and develop a greater appreciation for
the arts through these shared experiences.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This initiative is in line with our aspiration for <em>Our SG Arts Plan (2023 - 2027)</em> to
build <em>A Connected Society</em>, where our social connections and national
identity are strengthened through the arts.</p>
