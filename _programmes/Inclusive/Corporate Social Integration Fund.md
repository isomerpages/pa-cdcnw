The **Corporate Social Integration (CSI) Fund** is a partnership between National Integration Council (NIC) and the five Community Development Councils (CDCs) to promote quality and sustainable workplace integration.

The CSI Fund aims to encourage corporate stakeholders to support Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and volunteerism efforts in the community through projects which:

**1. Create Platforms for local/foreign employees from corporate organisations and the local community to interact;**

**2. Raise awareness of workplace integration amongst corporate organisations and Trade Associations and Chambers (TACs); and**

**3. Encourage and support corporate organisations in developing sustainable projects that promote engagement with, and contribution to, the community.**
