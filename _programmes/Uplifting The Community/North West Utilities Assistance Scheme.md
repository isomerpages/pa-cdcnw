The **North West Utilities Assistance Scheme** aims to help needy families facing imminent disconnection to defray their utility expenses. These families will then be able to offset water-related utilities arrears or avoid having their power supply disconnected.

Community organisations can submit a referral for clients by emailing us at northwest_cdc@pa.gov.sg.
