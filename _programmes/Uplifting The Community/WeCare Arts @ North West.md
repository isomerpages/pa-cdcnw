**WeCare Arts @ North West** is a collaboration with the National Arts Council (NAC) that aims to outreach to youths and elderly through the arts. This programme aims to support projects that involve artists working directly with Social Service Agencies (SSAs).  
  
The projects span across various art forms such as Dance, Music, Theatre, Visual Arts, Literary Arts and Multi-Disciplinary Arts. At North West CDC, participants under the programme are exposed to art forms such as Chinese Calligraphy, Rangoli Art and Visual Arts.
