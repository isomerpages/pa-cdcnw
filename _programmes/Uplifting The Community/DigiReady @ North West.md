![](/images/Programmes/Uplifting%20The%20Community/IMG012.jpg)**DigiReady @ North West** is an initiative to provide holistic support to vulnerable residents in the following aspects of digital readiness: refurbished devices and accessories, subsidised broadband, and troubleshooting faulty digital devices.

**1. Support on Digital Devices**

Students, seniors and families from low-income backgrounds may request for free refurbished devices through our community partners (e.g. Community Clubs and Social Service Agencies).

**2. Subsidised broadband**

The scheme further subsidises broadband access for beneficiaries under IMDA's Home Access Scheme, by providing additional subsidies of up to $250, for a period of three years contract. 

[Download the poster](/files/DigiReady%20@%20North%20West.pdf) for more information on eligibility criteria and application process for the subsidised broadband.
