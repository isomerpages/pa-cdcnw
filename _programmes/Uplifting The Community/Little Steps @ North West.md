**Little Steps @ North West** aims to provide cash assistance to children aged up to six years old, in the North West district, who are supported by KidSTART Singapore (SG). Each child will receive $500 per financial year disbursed to the parents’ and caregivers’ bank accounts. The additional cash assistance will help to relieve families’ stress from upkeeping daily expenses, thus enabling them to focus on the children’s development.

The grant is eligible for families with young children up to six years old, who are enrolled under KidSTART SG, and living in the North West District.
