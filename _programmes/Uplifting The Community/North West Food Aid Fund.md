The **North West Food Aid Fund (FAF)** is a local assistance scheme administered by the North West CDC. It aims to complement the National ComCare Scheme by supporting financially challenged residents who do not meet the National ComCare scheme criteria but are still in need of help to defray their household expenses.

The fund supports the provision of Food Vouchers to the families and yearly festive food packs to those staying in the rental flats within the North West District.

**North West Food Aid Vouchers**

The North West Food Aid Vouchers help financially challenged families to alleviate their monthly household expenses on food. Each approved household may receive up to $120 supermarket vouchers per month for up to a period of 6 months. 

North West CDC identifies the beneficiaries jointly with the Grassroots Organisations in the North West District.

**Eligibility Criteria**

*	Singapore Citizen, or Permanent Resident (at least one immediate family member in the same household must be a Singapore Citizen)

*	Resident of the North West District

*	Monthly household income of ≤$1,900 or Monthly Per Capita Income of ≤$750

North West CDC sustains the North West Food Aid Fund through the following approaches:

* GIRO donations
The CDC gathers support from the Community through GIRO donations from the public to contribute to the North West FAF specifically.

* Club-100 @ North West
The Club-100 @ North West was set up in May 2008 to promote the culture of giving back and serve as a network for corporate and individual members to pledge a monthly donation of $100 (or more) of their net profit or income to worthy causes for the benefit of the community.

* Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) projects
North West CDC gathers support from corporate organisations and community partners by tapping on their expertise and resources for collaborations as part of their CSR efforts.
