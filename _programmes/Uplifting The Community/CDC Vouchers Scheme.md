To thank Singaporeans for their sense of solidarity during the pandemic, and to support our hawkers and heartland merchants affected by the pandemic, the five Community Development Councils (CDCs) launched the $130 million CDC Vouchers Scheme for all Singaporean households on 13 December 2021. 

The Scheme was launched by Guest-of-Honour Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, also Chairman of People’s Association (PA). Singaporean households will each receive $100 in CDC vouchers which can be spent at the participating hawkers and heartland merchants.  
  
In addition, Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong announced during Budget 2022 that the Community Development Councils (CDCs) will be giving three new tranches of the CDC Vouchers Scheme from 2022 to 2024 to support Singaporeans during difficult times. Each Singaporean household will receive another $100 to help in daily expenses as part of the Household Support Package.
  
To claim the vouchers, one member of the household can go to [**go.gov.sg/cdcv**](https://signup.redeem.gov.sg/campaign_df2e6812-0192-491e-b1cc-d9887600639e?lang=en-US) and log in via Singpass. A CDC Vouchers link will be sent to the registered mobile phone number of the user, and this link can be shared with other household members.   
  
If you do not have a smartphone or Singpass, please visit your nearest Community Centre/Club (CC) for assistance.
