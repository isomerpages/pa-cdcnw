<meta name="description" content="North West Student Support Fund">

The **North West Student Support Fund (SSF)** provides financial assistance to defray educational expenses, and the opportunities to attend developmental programmes for students from less-privileged backgrounds.  

Through its two social mobility pillars – **Student Assist** and **Student Wise** programmes, the SSF has benefitted over 130,000 needy students since 2011. 

**Student Assist Programme**

**(a) North West Heart for Students Programme**  
  
The CDC works closely with Ministry of Education and the schools within the North West District to identify the beneficiaries. Schools will rally their community to support and contribute to the fund, to help families with financial difficulties to cope with their children’s school expenses. The donations raised by the schools’ community will be matched by the CDC.  

**(b) WeCare @ North West - Ready for School**

Bursaries are given to kindergarten students to purchase school essentials for their formal education in primary school. The CDC works closely with Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) and GROs to identify and disburse the funds.

 **Student Wise Programme**

**(a) North West Student Wise Enrichment Programme**

The CDC works closely with schools located within the North West District to identify the students. Students will attend a series of workshops to develop skills in listening and communications, social etiquette, and public speaking. They also attend motivational workshops to build confidence and improve their interpersonal skills in social settings.
