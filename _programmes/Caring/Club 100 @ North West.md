<p>Founded in 2008, <strong>Club-100 @ North West</strong> is championed by
a network of compassionate donors who simply want to do good and do more
for the less-privileged, the philanthropic club has forged a strong culture
of giving back. Each donor contributes a minimum of $100 monthly in an
individual or corporate capacity or donates a lump sum amount to provide
sustained and timely assistance to the North West community.</p>
<p>The programme has since been expanded to cover more areas of support and
assist more needy residents. Additional support will be given to residents
struggling with making ends meet due to <strong>the rising cost of living, the financial strain of raising children, unforeseen yet essential expenses for the household, or emergency situations at home</strong>.
The unwavering contributions from our donors through Club-100 @ North West
will create a profound and lasting impact to the lives of less-privileged
families.</p>
