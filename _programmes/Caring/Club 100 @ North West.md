<p>Founded in 2008, <strong>Club-100 @ North West</strong> is championed by
a network of compassionate donors who simply want to do good and do more
for the less-privileged, the philanthropic club has forged a strong culture
of giving back. Each donor contributes a minimum of $100 monthly in an
individual or corporate capacity or donates a lump sum amount to provide
sustained and timely assistance to the North West community.</p>
<p>Since 2024, the programme has been expanded to cover more areas of support
and to assist more needy residents. Additional support will be given to
residents struggling with making ends meet due to the rising cost of living,
the financial strain of raising children, unforeseen yet essential expenses
for the household, or emergency situations at home. The unwavering contributions
from our donors through Club-100 @ North West will create a profound and
lasting impact to the lives of less-privileged families.</p>
