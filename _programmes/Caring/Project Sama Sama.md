<p><strong>Project Sama-Sama</strong> provides 24/7 self-serve assistance
to needy residents in the North West through vending machines stocked with
household essentials such as food, toiletries, hygiene and clean products
at various touch points in the District.</p>
<p>The project hopes to bring everyone together to provide sustained support
and build the kampong spirit by enabling those with more to share with
those with less.</p>
<p>Project Sama-Sama is the brainchild of SPH Media, Auresys and North West
CDC. For sponsorship opportunities, please download our <a href="/files/Project_Sama_Sama_Marketing_Kit.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Marketing Kit</a> for
