<p>North West CDC came together with partners Singapore Press Holdings (SPH)
and Auresys Pte Ltd with one main goal, which is to provide timely and
sustained support to needy North West residents. After months of ideation,
market research and planning, <strong>Project Sama Sama @ North West</strong> was
conceived.</p>
<p>So what is <strong>Project Sama Sama @ North West</strong>? The word Sama
Sama simply means togetherness and rekindling a <em>kampung spirit </em>within
the North West District, made possible through this tripartite partnership.</p>
<p>It serves to provide a 24/7 assistance to identified needy residents in
the North West, through vending machines stocked with daily essentials
such as fresh food, toiletries, hygiene and cleaning products. Identified
residents would be issued free credits to redeem items at their convenience.
This partnership provides an extension of support to help our residents
alleviate cost-of-living pressures in addition to the assistance rendered
under the CDCâ€™s North West Service Weeks.</p>
<p>Corporate and individual sponsors have taken warmly to Project Sama Sama
@ North West, stepping forward and touching the community with their generosity.
However, in the current environment of rising cost-of-living, the stress
of daily expenses continues to pose challenges to less-privileged residents.
Hence, North West CDC, SPH and Auresys continue to seek the support of
sponsors to open their hearts and contribute to the meaningful cause. With
sponsorship support, more residents can receive timely assistance through
the project. &nbsp;</p>
<p>To explore sponsorship opportunities, do download the Project Sama Sama
Marketing Kit for more information, and contact our partner SPH for details.
Remember, regardless of where we start or where we are today, we are in
this together, and could all lend a helping hand to uplift someone in need.</p>
