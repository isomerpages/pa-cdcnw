<p><strong>WeCare Arts Experience @ North West</strong> is a collaboration
between the National Arts Council (NAC) and the five Community Development
Councils (CDCs).</p>
<p>&nbsp;It encourages beneficiaries from less privileged backgrounds to
access ticketed arts and cultural experiences curated by the NAC and Singaporeâ€™s
cultural institutions for free. Beneficiaries are also encouraged to attend
with immediate family members, caregivers or befrienders, for the opportunity
to bond over a shared arts experience and strengthen social ties.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Social Service Agencies (SSAs), and community partners such as Grassroots
Organisations (GROs) and Self-Help Group (SHGs) can apply for this scheme.</p>
