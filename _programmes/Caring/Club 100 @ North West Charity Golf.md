**Club-100 @ North West Charity Golf** is an annual fundraiser to support [Club-100 @ North West's](https://northwest.cdc.gov.sg/programmes/connecting-the-community/club100-northwest/) mission in providing timely assistance to residents in need. Since 2009, the donations have supported over 100,000 needy residents in the North West to defray household expenses. 

You too can make a difference to the lives of less-privileged residents. Join us for a day of golf and/or purchase a dinner table for a meaningful cause! Read more in the [marketing kit](/files/Club_100_Charity_Golf_2024.pdf).
