<p>Together with our partners Singapore Press Holdings (SPH) and Auresys
Pte Ltd, <strong>Project Sama Sama @ North West </strong>has one main goal,
which is to provide timely and sustained support to needy North West residents.</p>
<p>After months of ideation, market research and planning, Project Sama Sama
@ North West was conceived. The word Sama Sama simply means togetherness
and rekindling a <em>kampung spirit </em>within the North West District,
made possible through this tripartite partnership. It serves to provide
a 24/7 assistance to identified needy residents in the North West, through
vending machines stocked with daily essentials such as fresh food, toiletries,
hygiene and cleaning products. Identified residents would be issued free
credits to redeem items at their convenience. This partnership provides
an extension of support to help our residents alleviate cost-of-living
pressures in addition to the assistance rendered under the CDCâ€™s <a href="go.gov.sg/nw-service-weeks" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">North West Service Weeks</a>.</p>
<p>Corporate and individual sponsors have taken warmly to Project Sama Sama
@ North West, stepping forward and touching the community with their generosity.
However, in the current environment of rising cost-of-living, the stress
of daily expenses continues to pose challenges to less-privileged residents.
Hence, North West CDC, SPH and Auresys continue to seek the support of
sponsors to open their hearts and contribute to the meaningful cause. With
sponsorship support, more residents can receive timely assistance through
the project. &nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Regardless of where we start or where we are today, we are in this together, and could all lend a helping hand to uplift someone in need.</em>
