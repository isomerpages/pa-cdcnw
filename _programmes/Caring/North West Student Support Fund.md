**North West Student Support Fund (SSF)**  supports students from less privileged backgrounds with financial assistance to defray educational expenses, and the opportunity to attend development programmes to help them grow to their full potential.

Through its two social mobility pillars – **Student Assist** and **Student Wise** programmes, the SSF has benefitted over 130,000 needy students since 2011. 

##### **Student Assist Programme**

**(a) North West Heart for Students Programme**  
  
North West CDC works closely with Ministry of Education and the schools within the North West District to identify the beneficiaries. The schools play a part in rallying their community to support and contribute to support their peers who are facing financial difficulties. The donations raised by the schools’ community will be matched by the CDC.  

**(b) WeCare @ North West - Ready for School**

   The programme provides kindergarten students from less privileged backgrounds who are entering primary school with vouchers to purchase school essentials for their formal education. North West CDC works closely with the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) and Grassroots Organisations to identify eligible students and disburse the vouchers.

#####  **Student Wise Programme**

**(a) North West Student Wise Enrichment Programme**

North West CDC works closely with schools located within the North West District to identify students from less privileged backgrounds. Students will attend a series of workshops which complement the school curriculum, and allows them to develop skills in financial literacy, social etiquette, and public speaking. They also attend motivational workshops to build confidence and improve their interpersonal skills in social settings.
