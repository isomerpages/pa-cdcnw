**North West Service Weeks** provides quarterly food assistance to needy North West residents residing in public rental flats and under the local welfare schemes.

Corporate and community volunteers work together to run a Pop-Up Market and assist residents in customising their food packs. Some corporate partners even go the extra mile to provide home improvement services, while others may top up with additional items or vouchers for residents.

Corporates or community organisations who are keen to participate in the programme, please email northwestcdc_partnerships@pa.gov.sg.

Residents requiring more information, please email northwest_cdc@pa.gov.sg or call our hotline at **6248 5566**.
