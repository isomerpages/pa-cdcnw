The **North West Food Aid Fund (FAF)** is a local assistance scheme administered by the North West CDC. It aims to complement the National ComCare Scheme by supporting low-income families who do not meet the National ComCare scheme criteria but are still in need to alleviate their monthly household expenses on food. Each approved household may receive up to $120 supermarket vouchers per month for up to a period of 6 months.

North West CDC identifies the beneficiaries jointly with the Grassroots Organisations in the North West District. Eligible residents may head down to the nearest community clubs to apply.

**Eligibility Criteria**

*	Singapore Citizen, or Permanent Resident (at least one immediate family member in the same household must be a Singapore Citizen)

*	Resident of the North West District

*	Monthly household income of ≤$3,500 or Monthly Per Capita Income of ≤$1,000
