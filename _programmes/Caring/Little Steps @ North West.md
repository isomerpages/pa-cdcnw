**Little Steps @ North West** provides cash assistance to children aged up to six years old in the North West district, who are supported by KidSTART Singapore (SG), to help relieve their families' financial stress from upkeeping daily expenses. Each eligible child will receive $500 per financial year disbursed to the parents’ or caregivers’ bank accounts.

Important to note:

Each eligible child will receive a letter from the North West CDC to register for Little Steps @ North West. Upon successful verification of all supporting documents, the child will be enrolled into the programme, and a confirmation letter will be mailed to the registered address.

As the applications are processed in batches, any incomplete submission of documents will result in a delay in the crediting of the cash assistance.
