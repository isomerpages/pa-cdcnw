<p>In collaboration with SPH Media Limited and Auresys Pte Ltd, we have united
with a main goal, which is to provide timely and sustained support to needy
North West residents. After months of ideation, market research and planning
the vision for <strong>Project Sama Sama @ North West</strong> was born.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So what is <strong>Project Sama Sama @ North West</strong>? The word "Sama
Sama" simply means togetherness and fostering a sense of community within
the North West District. Its mission is to extend around-the-clock assistance
to identified needy residents in the North West, through vending machines
stocked with essential items from grocery to personal hygiene products.
They will receive complimentary credits to redeem these necessities at
their convenience.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This collaboration provides additional support to help our residents cope
with the rising cost of living, complementing the assistance provided during
<a href="https://northwest.cdc.gov.sg/programmes/connecting-the-community/nw-serviceweeks/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">North West Service Weeks</a>. The stress of daily expenses continues to
pose a challenge to needy residents, this is why we are appealing to potential
sponsors to join us in this meaningful cause. With sponsorship, more residents
can receive the timely assistance they require through this initiative.</p>
