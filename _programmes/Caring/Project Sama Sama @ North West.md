<p>In collaboration with SPH Media Limited and Auresys Pte Ltd, we have united
with a singular objective: to offer continuous and timely support to underprivileged
residents of the North West. Following extensive brainstorming, market
analysis, and strategic planning, the vision for <strong>Project Sama Sama @ North West</strong> was
born.</p>
<p></p>
<p>What exactly is <strong>Project Sama Sama @ North West</strong>? The term
"Sama Sama" embodies the spirit of unity and fostering a sense of community
within the North West District, made achievable through this three-way
partnership. Its mission is to extend around-the-clock assistance to identified
needy residents through vending machines stocked with essential items from
grocery to personal hygiene products. These residents will receive complimentary
credits to redeem these necessities at their convenience. This collaboration
acts as an additional support system to help residents cope with the rising
cost of living, complementing the aid provided during North West Service
Weeks.</p>
<p></p>
<p>With the rising cost of living, financially struggling residents continue
to face hardship. This is why we are appealing to potential sponsors to
join us in this meaningful cause. With sponsorship, more residents can
receive the timely assistance they require through this initiative.</p>

<p><em>Regardless of where we start or where we are today, we are in this together, and could all lend a helping hand to uplift someone in need.</em>
