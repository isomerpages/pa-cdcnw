<p>In collaboration with SPH Media and Auresys Pte Ltd, we have united with
one main goal, which is to provide timely and sustained support to less-privileged
North West residents. After months of ideation, extensive market research
and planning, the vision for <strong>Project Sama Sama @ North West</strong> was
born.</p>
<p>So what is <strong>Project Sama Sama @ North West</strong>? The word "Sama
Sama" simply means togetherness and fostering a sense of community within
the North West District. The project aims to extend 24/7 assistance to
identified needy residents in the North West, through vending machines
stocked with daily essentials such as fresh food, toiletries, hygiene and
cleaning products. Identified residents will receive complimentary credits
to redeem these necessities at their convenience. This collaboration provides
additional support to help our residents cope with the rising cost of living,
complementing the assistance provided during <a href="https://northwest.cdc.gov.sg/programmes/connecting-the-community/nw-serviceweeks/" class="fui-Link ___1rxvrpe f2hkw1w f3rmtva f1ewtqcl fyind8e f1k6fduh f1w7gpdv fk6fouc fjoy568 figsok6 f1hu3pq6 f11qmguv f19f4twv f1tyq0we f1g0x7ka fhxju0i f1qch9an f1cnd47f fqv5qza f1vmzxwi f1o700av f13mvf36 f1cmlufx f9n3di6 f1ids18y f1tx3yz7 f1deo86v f1eh06m1 f1iescvh fhgqx19 f1olyrje f1p93eir f1nev41a f1h8hb77 f1lqvz6u f10aw75t fsle3fq f17ae5zn" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">North West Service Weeks</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Corporate and individual sponsors have taken warmly to Project Sama Sama
@ North West, embracing the opportunity to make a positive impact on the
community through their generosity. However, the stress of daily expenses
continues to pose challenges to less-privileged residents. Hence, North
West CDC, SPH Media and Auresys continue to appeal to sponsors to open
their hearts and contribute to the meaningful cause. With sponsorship support,
more residents can receive timely assistance through the project.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
