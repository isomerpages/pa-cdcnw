**Budding Greenies @ North West** was officially launched in 2020 and aims to support pre-school centres in creating a Green Learning corner to educate pre-schoolers on environmental conservation and good eco habits via story-telling and play activities.  

In 2021, North West CDC developed and published a home-based version of ‘Go Green with Betty the Butterfly’ activity book and a parent’s guidebook, ensuring that sustainability education continues at home and is unaffected by school closures due to Covid-19.

Preschools who are on board the programme will receive the following resources and financial support to ensure environmental education starts young to nurture a generation of eco-conscious students:  

1.	Up to $800 funding per financial year 
2.	A Teacher’s Guide to creating Green Corners and activities within the preschools
3.	‘Go Green with Betty the Butterfly’ activity book for lessons
4.	Home-based activity book and parent’s guidebook


Preschools can apply for this programme on an annual basis. Applications open annually from 1 April, and approved projects must be completed by end March of the following year.
