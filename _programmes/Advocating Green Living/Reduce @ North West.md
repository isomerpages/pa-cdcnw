**Reduce At North West**  was launched in 2011 to educate and encourage residents to do their part in fighting climate change by reducing energy consumption.  

In 2017, the scope of the programme was expanded to include messages of reducing water consumption and food wastage. 

Trained students will conduct house visits to promote energy and water conservation, and reducing food wastage. They will also share the messages to their network of friends and family to encourage them to do a self-audit of their bills and pledge to incorporate a green habit in their lifestyles.  

Residents who are keen to participate in the pledge can fill up the application form [here](https://go.gov.sg/reduce-sign-up). 5 lucky residents in the North West district who pledge will win a $20 grocery e-voucher each month. Winners will be announced quarterly.
