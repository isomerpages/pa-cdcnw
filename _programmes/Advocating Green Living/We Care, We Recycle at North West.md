<meta name="description" content="We Care, We Recycle at North West">


**We Care, We Recycle @ North West** was launched in 2014 to instill good recycling habits from young. North West CDC partner with ALBA, SembWaste, National Environment Agency (NEA), ASM International and Schools in the North West District to encourage normal & E-waste recycling by the schools in North West District. 

The programme encourages setup of recycling points in schools, where students gather to collect recyclables at least once a month and are trained on the proper recycling habits and to put the knowledge learnt to good use. For E-waste recycling, we encourage schools to recycle e-waste on annual basis as we don’t foresee students will recycle e-waste as frequently as the normal recyclable items.
