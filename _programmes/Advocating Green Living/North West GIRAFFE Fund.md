The **North West GIRAFFE Fund** (Get Involved, Reach Out and Act! Fund for the Environment) was set up in 2009 to support ground-up environmental projects for the environment, by schools and community organisations in the North West District.  To qualify for the fund, projects should promote environmental education and enhance community participation in environmental activities.  If your school or community organisation is keen to sign up for this programme, please contact David Lee at David_Lee@pa.gov.sg
