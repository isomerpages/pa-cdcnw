The first-ever North West Sustainability Festival is a dynamic showcase of green efforts, with workshops and activities for you to learn about green living.

**There's so much to learn at the North West Sustainability Festival. Come join us from 31 October to 5 November 2023, explore the interactive exhibitions and find out what are some simple yet eco-friendly practices you can adopt at home to protect our environment!**

Residents will be brought on a green journey through interactive exhibitions and games, and be educated on green tips to practise at home!

There are also novel activities for friends and families to have fun while learning about going green, such as charging up mobile phones by cycling, and marking the occasion by taking pictures at an Instagrammable green mirror.

**[Sign up](https://go.gov.sg/nwsfreg) and be inspired by our specially curated green workshops and talks!**

*NOTE: We are having some technical issues with the registration site. Please bear with us as we try our best to fix the problem as soon as possible. (Update as of 2 Nov 2023, 12.30pm)
