You can practise green living at home in so many ways! **[Register](https://go.gov.sg/nwsfreg)** and be inspired by what our specially curated workshops and activities have to offer!

Learn how you can turn trash into treasure by upcycling materials into products you can use, charge your mobile phone through cycling, and we shouldnâ€™t judge the food by its looks, ugly foods can be edible too! 

**Find out more on the workshops and activities that are available below!**
