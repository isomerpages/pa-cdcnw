**Keep Clean @ North West**, launched on 15 September 2016, and engages schools to adopt nearby precincts to keep clean, with the aim of reversing the littering trend in public spaces. Under the programme, schools will organise regular litter-picking activities and proactively spread anti-littering messages in their adopted precincts. The programme will impart good anti-littering habits for life, and instill a sense of responsibility for shared spaces.  In 2021, due to the COVID-19 situation and safe management measures, Keep Clean @ North West was restructured to strengthen the value of public hygiene ownership by involving students in routine litter-picking activities in schools, and encouraging students to have a sense of responsibility for shared spaces.  Schools interested in being a part of Keep Clean @ North West may contact David Lee at [David\_Lee@pa.gov.sg](mailto:David_Lee@pa.gov.sg).
