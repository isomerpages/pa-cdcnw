**Keep Clean @ North West** engages schools to adopt nearby precincts to keep clean, with the aim of reversing the littering trend in public spaces. Under the programme, schools will organise regular litter-picking activities and proactively spread anti-littering messages in their adopted precincts. The programme will impart good anti-littering habits for life, and instill a sense of responsibility for shared spaces.  

In 2021, Keep Clean @ North West was restructured to strengthen the value of public hygiene ownership by involving students in routine litter-picking activities in schools, and encouraging students to have a sense of responsibility for shared spaces.  Schools interested in being a part of this programme may contact David Lee at [David\_Lee@pa.gov.sg](mailto:David_Lee@pa.gov.sg).
