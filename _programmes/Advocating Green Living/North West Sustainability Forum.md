**North West Sustainability Forum** is held frequently throughout the year; focusing on the education about Climate Change and Environmental Sustainability. Subject experts are invited to share on their experiences and insights, enabling participants more in-depth learning and the opportunity to hear from community change-drivers as well as exchange ideas with other passionate environmentalists. Participants are also encouraged to initiate ground up projects related to sustainability.  

Financial support and guidance are provided to residents in the North West who are inspired to initiate ground-up projects to take climate action after the forum. 

Organisations who are active in the sustainability sector and passionate about green initiatives are welcome to curate a North West Sustainability Forum, or be featured as a speaker in one of our forums. Interested parties may email northwest_cdc@pa.gov.sg for collaboration opportunities.
