![](/images/Programmes/Green%20Living/IMG%20(164).jpg)The **North West Sustainability Forum** is held frequently throughout the year and focuses on education about climate change and environmental sustainability. Subject experts and key figures are invited to share about their experiences and insights, and participants use this platform to hear from community change-drivers and exchange ideas with other passionate environmentalists. Participants are also encouraged to initiate ground up projects related to sustainability.  

Financial support and guidance is provided to residents in the North West district who are inspired to initiate ground up projects to take climate action after the forums.  

Organizations who are active in the sustainability sector and passionate about green initiatives are welcome to contact us to be featured as a speaker on our North West Sustainability Forums. 

Residents who are keen to attend the upcoming forums can also contact us to be added in our mailing list.
