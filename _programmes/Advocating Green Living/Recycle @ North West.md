**Recycle @ North West** aims to encourage active recycling among residents in the North West District and create bonding among residents through a common platform at the recycling points. This programme is organised by North West CDC together with Tzu Chi Foundation (Singapore), Singapore Environment Council (SEC) and National Environment Agency (NEA), SembWaste and Alba.

Active recycling breaks away from the current recycling practices. Green volunteers will share with residents on the importance of reducing and reusing; and how to recycle and what to recycle.  Residents in turn will learn more about resource conservation and get hands-on experiential learning and be involved in sorting the recyclables.  In the process, families, neighbours, young and old, can bond and make new friends while recycling.

**Recycle @ North West (Schools)**

Launched in 2014 to instill good recycling habits from young, North West CDC works closely with ALBA, SembWaste, National Environment Agency (NEA), ASM International and Schools in the North West District to encourage normal & E-waste recycling by the schools in North West District. 

The programme encourages setup of recycling points in schools, where students gather to collect recyclables at least once a month and are trained on the proper recycling habits and to put the knowledge learned to good use. For E-waste recycling, we encourage schools to recycle e-waste on annual basis as we don’t foresee students will recycle e-waste as frequently as the normal recyclable items.
