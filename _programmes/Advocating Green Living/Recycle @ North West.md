![](/images/Programmes/Green%20Living/Recycle%201.jpg)**Recycle @ North West** aims to encourage active recycling among residents in the North West District and create bonding among residents through a common platform at the recycling points. This programme is organised by North West CDC together with Tzu Chi Foundation (Singapore), Singapore Environment Council (SEC) and National Environment Agency (NEA), SembWaste and Alba.

Active recycling breaks away from the current recycling practices. Green volunteers will share with residents on the importance of reducing and reusing; and how to recycle and what to recycle.  Residents in turn will learn more about resource conservation and get hands-on experiential learning and be involved in sorting the recyclables.  In the process, families, neighbours, young and old, can bond and make new friends while recycling.
