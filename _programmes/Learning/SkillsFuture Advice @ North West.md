**Skills Framework**

Discover the [**Skills Framework**](https://www.skillsfuture.gov.sg/skills-framework), an integral component of the Industry Transformation Maps. Co-created by employers, industry associations, education institutions, unions, and the government, it provides key sector information, job roles, and the required existing and emerging skills. Designed to deepen workforce capabilities, it enhances business competitiveness and supports employability.

**SkillsFuture Level-Up Programme**

Starting 1 May 2024, eligible Singaporeans aged 40 years and above can tap on the $4,000 SkillsFuture Credit (Mid-Career) top-up to offset course fees for selected courses. This initiative supports reskilling and upskilling in high-demand sectors.

For more information on the programme and a list of eligible courses, visit the [SkillsFuture website](https://www.skillsfuture.gov.sg/level-up-programme).

**SkillsFuture Mid-Career Training Allowance**

From early 2025, Singaporeans can embrace new career opportunities through the SkillsFuture Mid-Career Training Allowance, which provides financial support for individuals attending eligible training courses. This allowance helps ease the transition for mid-career professionals into new roles or industries by pursuing substantive reskilling through full-time, long-form training.
