**Club-100 @ North West Charity Golf** is a key fundraising event [Club-100 @ North West](https://northwest.cdc.gov.sg/programmes/connecting-the-community/club100-northwest/). Since 2009, it has provided another avenue to increase the contributions to Club-100 @ North West, which supports the less-privileged residents in the North West. 

Club-100 @ North West Charity Golf 2023 is back! We invite you to join us for a fun-filled day of golf and dinner, and bond with like-minded individuals for a meaningful cause!

Your support by purchasing a golf flight and/or dinner table for our Club-100 @ North West Charity Golf 2023 will provide a helping hand to our less-privileged residents, and strengthen the spirit of care in our North West.
