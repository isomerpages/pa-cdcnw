The **North West Youth Concert** creates a platform for corporate donors to give back to the community and raise funds for the [North West Student Support Fund](https://northwest.cdc.gov.sg/programmes/assisting-the-needy/northwest-student-supportfund), as well as enables youths to showcase their artistic talents for a good cause.

*“The community’s spirit of giving is amplified  through the North West Youth Concert, which enables the SSF to provide less-privileged students with equal learning opportunities to grow to their fullest potential. It is heartening to see the community come together to support the SSF campaign; a testament to the strong relationships that the CDC has built with our partners."* 

**Mr Alex Yam, Mayor of North West District**
