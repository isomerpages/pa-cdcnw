The **Corporate Social Integration (CSI) Fund** is a partnership between the five Community Development Councils (CDCs) and National Integration Council (NIC) to promote quality and sustainable workplace integration.

The CSI Fund aims to encourage corporate stakeholders in the community to organise projects, which would benefit needy families and senior residents living in the rental and studio apartments in the North West District.
