**WeCare @ North West – Service Weeks** aim to bring our community and corporate partners together, and provide festive cheers to the needy residents residing in public rental units in the North West District through the distribution of WeCare Festive Packs.

In 2022, 1,200 community and corporate volunteers came together over three weekends to distribute 7,300 festive bags to 20,000 residents living in the public rental units in 14 North West Divisions.  

Organisations can choose to provide additional support by sponsoring home improvement items or services such as like house cleaning; and home appliances such as televisions, washing machines and ovens, or topping up with items beyond food necessities.

Corporate organisations who are keen to join the programme, please email northwestcdc_partnerships@pa.gov.sg.
