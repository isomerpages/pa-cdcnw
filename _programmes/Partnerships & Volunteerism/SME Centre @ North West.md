<meta name="description" content="SME Centre @ North West">

On 10 July 2013, a MOU was signed between five local trade associations, SPRING Singapore and the People’s Association to set up Small and Medium-sized enterprise (SME) Centres within the five Community Development Councils (CDCs). 

Located in the North West District, the SME Centre @ North West is one of the five centres that aim to provide free business advices to help SMEs develop core business capabilities.

The webinars are free to attend and cover topics such as grants and programmes from Budget 2020 to support SMEs and other relevant topics including excelling in the digital sphere and building up human capital.
