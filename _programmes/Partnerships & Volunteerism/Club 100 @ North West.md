![](/images/Programmes/Partnership%20&%20Volunteerism/IMG028.jpg)**Club-100 @ North West** is the North West CDC’s flagship philanthropic club, which was formed by a community of passionate
do-gooders who wanted to give back to vulnerable residents in the North West District. Members of the club contribute a minimum of $100 monthly, which goes entirely towards the [North West Food Aid Fund](https://northwest.cdc.gov.sg/programmes/assisting-the-needy/northwest-food-aid-fund).


*"Our members within Club-100 @ North West play a very key role in supporting the North West Food Aid Fund (FAF) in reaching out to, and providing for, needy families within the North West District. Club-100 @ North West is one example of how a passionate group of people can come together and make a significant difference."*
