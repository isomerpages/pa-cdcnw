The **Club-100 @ North West Fundraising Golf & Dinner** raises funds for the [North West Food Aid Fund (FAF)](https://northwest.cdc.gov.sg/programmes/assisting-the-needy/northwest-food-aid-fund), which supports the vulnerable residents in the North West community. 

The North West FAF supports needy households with Food Rations and Food Aid Vouchers to defray their daily household expenses. Your valuable contributions will make an impact to the lives of more of such families needing food assistance.
