Adults with disabilities looking to upskill, or go for training, can now tap on the new ‘Temasek Trust-CDC Lifelong Learning Enabling Fund’ and submit their applications at [go.gov.sg/temasektrust-cdc-fund](go.gov.sg/temasektrust-cdc-fund).  
 
This Fund is set up by Temasek Trust's&nbsp;Oscar@sg Fund, North West CDC, together with the other Community Development Councils (CDCs), and is administered by SG Enable. It was launched in September 2021 amidst COVID-19, where home-based learning, working from home and widespread use of technology are now part of the new normal.  
  
This fund aims to enable adults with disabilities to acquire the relevant vocational and independent living skills to emerge stronger!
