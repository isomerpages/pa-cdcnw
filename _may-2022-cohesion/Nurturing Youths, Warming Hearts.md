##### Uplifting students from disadvantaged backgrounds

Launched in 2011, the SSF provides bursaries, upstream education and developmental programmes for students from vulnerable families so they can enjoy the same opportunities as their peers. The SSF aims to uplift students through its two pillars â€“ Student Assist and Student Wise.

#### Signature programmes of the North West Student Support Fund

* Student Assist Programme<br>
